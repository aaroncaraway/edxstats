# LEAVE-ONE-OUT CROSS VALIDATION (LOOCV)

glm = generalized linear models

```{r}
require(ISLR)
require(boot)
```

## USE SUMMARY TO FIND STD.ERROR ETC.

```{r}
load("Documents/EDXStats/5.R.RData")
glm.fit=glm(y~X1+X2, data=Xy)

summary(glm.fit)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
